# üè° Ames Housing Price Prediction Web App

- **Source**: [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset)
- **Attributes**: The dataset contains 80+ variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
- **Target**: `SalePrice` ‚Äì the final price of the house.

Only **numeric** columns are used in training to ensure compatibility and simplify preprocessing. Missing values are dropped for cleaner model inputs.

## ü§ñ ML Model Training

Training was done in `enhanced_train_model.py` using the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Drop missing `SalePrice` values and non-numeric columns.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Remove low-variance features (variance < 1.0).
   - Drop highly correlated features (correlation > 0.95).
3. **Scaling**: StandardScaler is applied to normalize the input features.
4. **Model Training**:
   - `Linear Regression`
   - `Ridge Regression`
   - `Lasso Regression`
   - `Random Forest`
   - `Gradient Boosting`
5. **Model Evaluation**: Models are scored using RMSE and R¬≤ metrics.
6. **Saving Artifacts**:
   - Trained models (`.pkl`)
   - Scaler (`scaler.pkl`)
   - Feature column names (`columns.pkl`)
   - Evaluation results (`results.pkl`)
